      <p><font size="6"><b>"Creating</b></font> and innovating the manual processes is what I love about being a BS in Computer Science. When I took this course,
	I had no idea what Computer Science was or how it could help. My first encounter with a programming language was C++, and I didn't understand
	it at first. However, as time went on, I embraces the essence of Computer Science, and by my fourth year, I could create basic web/mobile/system application
	on my own. Upon graduation, I was unlucky in finding a job related to my field of study. However, due to my eagerness to support my family financially,
	I took a job unrelated to my course. But my passion and dreams will not end here."
